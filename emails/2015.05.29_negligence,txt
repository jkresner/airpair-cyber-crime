Jonathan,

I appreciate how easy you have been to work with, and what you stand for. I'll do my best to make sure that the claim doesn't go against your record.

From a customer standpoint, I thought that as the CEO you would like to be aware that Prateek Gupta appears to be fraudulent for stating that a refund was issued when it never was. 

He also has horrible response times with customer-support emails.

Adam and I both want you to be wildly successful, and feel that you should be aware of such issues.
