Yes, that's fine. Increased to $150
I'm looking for a long-term Ubuntu/Debian SysAdmin to help guide me on some missing knowledge.

Hi Ryan,

I wanted to update you that I am still getting availability from experts, and looks like your budget is on the lower end for the expertise needed. Do you have any flexibility to bump it up to $150?

Please confirm.

Best,

Prateek
